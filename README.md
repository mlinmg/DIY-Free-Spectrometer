## List of material needed
1. All the parts in the 3D files folder needs to be printed
2. A cold white led aroud 3W potency
3. A DVD, non blu ray, to be open and cutted 
4. A camera like [this](https://www.amazon.it/Modulo-telecamera-OV3660-Uscita-Supporto/dp/B088P1PKFM/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?__mk_it_IT=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3LEQAI1MKVDN2&keywords=modulo+telecamera+usb+110%C2%B0&qid=1674423088&sprefix=modulo+telecamera+usb+110+%2Caps%2C160&sr=8-3-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&smid=A2ITG3U79VPZKX)
5. A mirror that can be broken
6. 2 3Mx10mm screw

## Instruction 
### 3D Printed parts
1. Print all the parts with a 3d printer. Print quality does not matter, all parts should be printed without supports
### Mirror
1. Break the mirror to obtain a piece that can be glued to the mirror 3D part
2. Glue the piece with some hotglue 
3. Screw one 3M screw to each side of the 3D printed mirro piece
### Light diffractor
1. **Put on some gloves, oil in the skin will ruin the diffraction grade**
2. Take the dvd 
3. Separate the 2 parts that compose the dvd
4. Cut a square out of the plae blue piece
5. Shine a light thru it to check the orientation, the rainbow should be horizontal, place the diffractor in the 3d printed piece named base
### Light lid
1. Glue the LED to the opening in the top of the 3d printed piece called light holder
2. Connect black(neutral) and red(positive) cables to the correspective poles of the LED
3. Pass the cables thru the slit in the lid
### Assembple everything 
1. Assemble every piece inside of the base piece, be careful when inserting your camera in the base, the cable should be connected to the camera BEFORE 
2. **Optional** If you know what are you doing you can attach the black and red cables of the led to the power supply of the camera, you also need to connect a resistance to lower the voltage to 2.9/3V 
3. Put on the base cover first and after put on the light holder
You should see something like this at this point

### Software
1. Download Theremino Spectrometer([here](https://www.theremino.com/wp-content/uploads/files/Theremino_Spectrometer_V3.1.zip))
2. Attach the usb, put some sample fluid above the slit and enjoy your spectrometer
